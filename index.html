<h2>What is Doguber?</h2>
<p>
Many people find it increasingly difficult to take time out of their day to walk their dogs.
Personal dog walkers are expensive while hired dog walkers might steal the dog.
Furthermore, dog owners are unable to track the dog’s whereabouts due to the lack of trust with the dog walker.

	<h3>Real-time Global Positioning System (GPS) Tracking</h3>
	<h1><em>So you never lose your dog!</em></h1>
	<p>
	We are the <em>first</em> in Singapore to use the GPS technology
	to ensure the safety of the dogs and give the owners a peace of mind.
	To complement the dog walking service, we sell a special dog collar with a
	built in Global Positioning System that synchronizes with our app, allowing
	owners to see where their dogs are.
	The GPS cannot be switched off by anyone but the owner, who would receive a special code upon purchase.

<li class="icon fa-dollar">
	<h3>Affordable rates through smart payment</h3>
	<h1><em>For everyone!</em></h1>

	When dog owners send out a request, they would have to transfer the indicated amount of money into the app using credit card/bank account.

	</p>

<li class="icon fa-comments">
	<h3>Communication</h3>
	<h1><em>To and fro</em></h1>
	<p>
	A private and encrypted chatroom in the app allows owners to communicate with the paired walker.
	Moreover, a feedback system is implemented in which dog owners/dog walkers can give each other feedback after a job request has been successfully completed
